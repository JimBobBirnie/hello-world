Hello world repository to understand how to use GitHub

Introduction
============

I started to seriously look for a new job in mid May 2015 and noticed that a lot of companies expect people to have an online presence.  I can't create ten year's history of blogs but I can at least create a GitHub repository of my own and start to get some stuff in it.  I've never previously seen the need to have my own GitHub repository as every piece of work I've ever done was for the companies I worked for at the time.  When I researched new technologies or made prototypes for new solutions I used the corporate source control solution.  I'm now in the position where I have no resources to call upon except in my memory.  I'll be working on some new things while I'm searching for a job and in future I'll be making sure I keep a personal online archive of useful and interesting stuff.
